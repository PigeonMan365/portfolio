# Paul Tucker's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.

I'm **Paul Tucker**, a Cybersecurity major at Radford University with minors in **GIS & Remote Sensing** and **Peace Studies**. I'm currently in my seventh semester and deeply interested in **offensive security**, as well as the **applications of AI in cybersecurity**. My goal is to blend technical expertise with a multidisciplinary approach to solve real-world security problems.

This repository serves as the hub for the projects I’m most confident in — from penetration testing tools to AI-driven model training frameworks. It reflects my hands-on learning, certifications, and self-directed passion projects.
