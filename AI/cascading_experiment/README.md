This is a basic experiment where the user asks a question.
That input is then piped to the first AI to generate a response.
Then the evaluator AI reviews it for reasoning, logic and completeness, then provides suggestions.
This basic script shows how two AI can work together to refine output/responses.
This is just a proof of concept that could logically be extended to any number of AI refining output for any specific task.
